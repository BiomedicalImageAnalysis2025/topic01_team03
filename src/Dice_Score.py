def dice_score(prediction: np.ndarray, ground_truth: np.ndarray) -> float:
    """
    Computes the Dice coefficient (Dice Similarity Coefficient, DSC) between two binary images.

    The Dice score quantifies the overlap between a predicted binary segmentation mask and the 
    corresponding ground-truth mask. It is defined as:
        DSC = 2 * |A âˆ© B| / (|A| + |B|)
    where A and B represent the sets of foreground pixels in the predicted and ground-truth masks,
    respectively.

    A Dice score of 1 indicates perfect overlap (i.e., identical masks), while 0 indicates no overlap.

    Args:
        prediction (np.ndarray): Binary predicted segmentation mask (dtype=bool).
        ground_truth (np.ndarray): Binary ground-truth segmentation mask (dtype=bool).

    Returns:
        float: Computed Dice score in the range [0.0, 1.0].

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input arrays do not have the same shape.

    # 3. Calculate the number of overlapping positive pixels (intersection)
    positive_overlap = np.sum(np.logical_and(prediction, ground_truth))

    # 4. Handle the edge case where both masks are empty (i.e., no positives in either image)
