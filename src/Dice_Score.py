    """
    Computes the Dice coefficient (Dice Similarity Coefficient, DSC) between two binary images
    and automatically thresholding grayscale images if needed.

    The Dice score quantifies the overlap between a predicted binary segmentation mask and the 
    corresponding ground-truth mask. It is defined as:
        DSC = 2 * |A âˆ© B| / (|A| + |B|)
    where A and B represent the sets of foreground pixels in the predicted and ground-truth masks,
    respectively.

    A Dice score of 1 indicates perfect overlap (i.e., identical masks), while 0 indicates no overlap.

    Args:
        prediction (np.ndarray): Binary predicted segmentation mask (dtype=bool).
        ground_truth (np.ndarray): Binary ground-truth segmentation mask (dtype=bool).
        threshold_pred (float, optional): Threshold for binarizing the predicted mask if not boolean. Defaults to 0.
        threshold_gt (float, optional): Threshold for binarizing the ground-truth mask if not boolean. Defaults to 0.
        
    Returns:
        float: Computed Dice score in the range [0.0, 1.0].

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input arrays do not have the same shape.
